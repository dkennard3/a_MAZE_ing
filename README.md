## It's a_MAZE_ing!
A fun exercise in Python Tkinter library, accomplished in thanks to the folks over from[Boots.dev](https://github.com/bootdotdev)!  

Initial commit here on Sept. 20th, 2023.  

Executing `maze.py` will render a window which will draw a maze grid gradually. Once finished, a red line appears at the start of the maze to attempt finding a path (via DFS) to the end. My first deep-dive into drawing on a GUI and emphasis on OOP paradigms in Python.  
More features to come in the future -- stay tuned.
